:mod:`time` ---  Time access and conversions
============================================

.. module:: time
   :synopsis: Time access and conversions.

This module provides various time-related functions.

----------------------------------------------


.. function:: time.sleep(secs)

   Suspend execution of the calling thread for the given number of
   seconds. The argument may be a floating point number to indicate a
   more precise sleep time. The actual suspension time may be less
   than that requested because any caught signal will terminate the
   `sleep()` following execution of that signalâ€™s catching
   routine. Also, the suspension time may be longer than requested by
   an arbitrary amount because of the scheduling of other activity in
   the system.


.. function:: time.sleep_ms(msecs)

   Same as `sleep()` but sleep for `msecs` number of milliseconds.
              

.. function:: time.sleep_us(usecs)

   Same as `sleep()` but sleep for `usecs` number of microseconds.

              
.. function:: time.time()

   Return the time in seconds since the epoch as a floating point
   number. Note that even though the time is always returned as a
   floating point number, not all systems provide time with a better
   precision than 1 second. While this function normally returns
   non-decreasing values, it can return a lower value than a previous
   call if the system clock has been set back between the two calls.
