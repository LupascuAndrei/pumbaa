:mod:`pumbaa` --- Pumbaa
========================

.. module:: pumbaa
   :synopsis: Pumbaa.

The pumbaa module is a thin layer on top of `Simba` to make most
`Simba` functionality available in `Python`. It is not intended to be
compatible with `MicroPython:s` hardware modules as of today.

----------------------------------------------

Classes
-------

.. class:: pumbaa.Timer(timeout, event, mask, flags=0)

   Instantiate a timer object from given arguemts. The timer expires
   `timeout` seconds after the timer has been started. When the timer
   expires given `mask` is written to given `event` channel.


   .. method:: start()
    
      Start the timer.
    

   .. method:: stop()
    
      Stop the timer. If the timer is stopped before it has expired it
      will never exipre. This function has no effect if the timer has
      already expired.
    
   .. data:: PERIODIC

      Pass this flag to ``pumbaa.Timer`` for periodic timers.

      
.. class:: pumbaa.Event(event)

   Initialize given event object.


   .. method:: read(mask)

      Wait for an event to occur and return a mask of all active
      events.


   .. method:: write(mask)

      Write given event(s) to the channel.


   .. method:: size()

      Get the number of event(s) set in the channel.

      
.. class:: pumbaa.Pin(device, mode)

   Initialize given pin object with given `device` and `mode`. The
   device is selected among the pins available in the `Board`
   class. Mode must be either `INPUT` or `OUTPUT`.

   
   .. method:: read()

      Read the current pin value and return it as an integer. Returns
      0 if the pin is low and 1 if the pin is high.


   .. method:: write(value)

      Write `value` to the pin. `value` must be an object that can be
      converted to an integer. The value is either 0 or 1, where 0 is
      low and 1 is high.


   .. method:: toggle()

      Toggle the pin output value (high/low).


   .. method:: set_mode(mode)

      Set the pin mode to given mode `mode`. The mode must be either
      ``INPUT`` or ``OUTPUT``.

   .. data:: INPUT

      Input pin mode.

   .. data:: OUTPUT

      Output pin mode.

      
.. class:: pumbaa.Dac(devices, sampling_rate)

   Instansiate a Dac object. `devices` is either a list of DAC pin
   devices or a single DAC pin device. The DAC pin devices can be
   found in the `Board` class, often named `PIN_DAC0` and `PIN_DAC1`.


   .. method:: convert(samples)

      Start a synchronous convertion of digital samples to an analog
      signal. This function returns when all samples have been
      converted.


   .. method:: async_convert(samples)

      Start an asynchronous convertion of digital samples to an analog
      signal. This function only blocks if the hardware is not ready
      to convert more samples. Call `async_wait()` to wait for an
      asynchronous convertion to finish.


   .. method:: async_wait()

      Wait for an ongoing asynchronous convertion to finish.


Functions
---------
      
.. function:: pumbaa.fs_call(command)

   Call given file system command. The output is written to the debug
   port and can not be captured in Python.
              
.. function:: pumbaa.fs_format(path)

   Format file system at given path. All data in the file system will
   be lost.
