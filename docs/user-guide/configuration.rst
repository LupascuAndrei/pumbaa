Configuration
=============

Standard Library
----------------

The :doc:`../library-reference` is configured at compile time using
defines that starts with ``CONFIG_PUMBAA_``. The default configuration
includes most functionality, as most application wants that. If an
application has special requirements, for example memory constraints,
it has to be configured to remove unnecessaray functionality.

The underlying MicroPython source code can also be configured in
compile time. Often these configuration valiables starts with
``MICROPY_``.

Simba can be configured as described in the `Simba documentation`_,
with the only difference that your ``config.h`` must include
``simba_config.h``, as in :github-blob:`src/config.h`. Put your
defines before this include.
